# Project Name: Cesium-Angular Sandbox

# Description:
This is just a starting template to work on your own cesium angular Web application.

# Instructions to run this angular app:
1.) Clone the repository, make sure to run npm install to get the node_modules folder with the third party software.
2.) In a terminal that has angular-cli installed, run ng serve -o to run the front-end under the myCesium directory.

# Usage
The mouse wheel is used to zoom in and out of the globe. Dragging the globe rotates the globe. Pressing Ctrl and dragging the mouse changes the camera angle.
